The MA_Minigrid library contains a collection of discrete grid-world environments to conduct research on Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning. The environments follow the Gymnasium and Minigrid standard API and they are designed to be lightweight, fast, and easily customizable.
This project is based on [Minigrid](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid) to support multi-agent interaction with environment.
